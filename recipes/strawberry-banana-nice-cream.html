        <li>Pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Seeds scraped from 1/2 vanilla bean.</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh strawberries, greens removed</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Rubber spatula</li>
        <li>Medium mixing bowl</li>

        <li>Put the bananas, cinnamon, and vanilla seeds in the blender and blend until smooth, starting on the lowest speed and working up to the fastest. Blend on the highest speed until the mixture is uniformly smooth. Use the tamper as needed to ensure that everything blends well. Reduce speed back down to the lowest setting before turning it off.</li>
        <li>Scrape the banana mixture into the mixing bowl with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Slice the strawberries and add them to the mixing bowl to mix together with the banana mixture. Serve the ice cream in the bowls to enjoy immediately!</li>

    <p>It is best to eat the banana nice cream immediately because it does not freeze well after melting.</p>
